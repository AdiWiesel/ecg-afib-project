## ECG Atrial Fibrillation Detection

## Goal
this projects aims to evaluate the performence of several machine learning methods to identify P WAVE absent and/or 
irregularly regular R-R intervals , 2 of the main visible Characteristic of Atrial fibrilation.

## Project structure
`ecg_basics.ipynb`: commented explaination of basic ECG interpetation and physiology behind it
- `dataset.ipynb`: data loading and feature extraction
- `fit.ipynb`: model training and evaluation
- `1d_CNN.ipynb`: deep learning CNN model (1d convo)
- `MLP_shallow.ipynb`: baseline shallow neural network
- `models.ipynb`: random forest and logistic regression
